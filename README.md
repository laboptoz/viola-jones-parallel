# Parallelizing Viola-Jones Facial Detection Algorithm 

This repository contains three different implementations of the Viola-Jones Object Detection algorithm. To simplify the implementations, we use a pre-trained cascade classifier and remove the training stage. 

## Execution

Each implementation can be executed by using a following command

To run program once
```
make
./vj
```

To run the benchmark program 
```
make
./benchmark.py
```
